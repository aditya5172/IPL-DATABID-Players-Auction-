## IPL Analysis Tool

This repository contains Python code for analyzing IPL (Indian Premier League) player chemistry, team comparison, and performing various statistical analyses on player data and team dynamics and recommend stackholder to make an efficient team on paper which will be competing.

## Introduction

This collection of Python scripts provides tools to analyze IPL player statistics, team dynamics, and chemistry among players. The scripts cover various aspects such as chemistry calculation, player comparison, team-vs-team analysis, and more.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the analysis tools on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python (version x.x.x)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tkinter (for GUI interface)

## Code Snippets

### Statitics of each Player: Player's Stats

- Description: This jupyter Notebook helps to calculate each players performance in IPL since 2008.
- Run the notebook to find each players stats.
- For Batsmen -- Runs Scored, Sixs, Fours, Fifties, Hundreds, Average, Strike Rate and a few more essential features.
- For Bowlers -- Wickets taken, Bowls Bowled, Economy, Average, No Balls Bowled, and a few more essential features.

### Preparing dataset for each player: Players Comparision Comparison and Analysis

- Description: This Python script helps to compares each players against another which will be used in the next code to perfrom its objectives
- Run the script to find player against player scores.

### Event_Final_code: Team Performance Analysis

- Description: This Python script a GUI interface to compare teams, analyze team dynamics, calculates team performance and generates points table based on team dynamics and chemistry.
- Run the script to analyze team performance and generate points table.

## Data

- The analysis uses data from various sources, including IPL matches and player statistics.
- Ensure that data files are placed in the appropriate directories before running the scripts.
## Datasets 

- 'IPL_Ball_by_Ball_2008_2021.csv' and 'IPL_Matches_2008_2021.csv' are the data extracted by kaggle.
- 'Data.csv' dataset is genereted in 'Preparing dataset of each player' which is used in 'Event_Final_code'
- 'All Players selling teams.xlsx' is a test dataset used to evaluate the efficiency

## Results

The analysis tools provide insights into player chemistry, team dynamics, and player statistics. The GUI application (Event_Final_code) offers an interactive way to explore team comparison and player analysis.

## Future Scope

- The code need to optimized.
- Deep learning model can be applied to recommend next player so that the stackholder can make better decision.
